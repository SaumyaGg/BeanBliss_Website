# 🫘 BeanBliss Website

The **BeanBliss Website** is a handcrafted frontend project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases a multi-page layout designed for a coffee brand, with sections like home, menu, and visuals that represent the theme of a coffee experience.

This project was created to demonstrate responsive layout skills, semantic HTML structure, and basic styling using SCSS/CSS.

The repository contains:

- A homepage (`index.html`) that welcomes visitors and introduces the brand
- A menu page (`menu.html`) to showcase coffee offerings
- A structured folder setup for styles, images, and assets
- Styles written with SCSS and compiled CSS
- Image assets for visual enhancement
